This project uses mySQL to help keep track of registered industry carbon footprints

The project allows users to keep track of any carbon footprints and/or offsets by certain industries/companies

It allows three kinds of users to exist: guest, admin and industry managers
Guests can view any information that are uploaded via the admin or managers
Managers can view any information, as well as add/edit their own
Admin has all read/write access to any information held

TO RUN:
Unzip the file, run the SQL file within first, then go into /backend/main.py and run it
